Reborn from the Shadows
-
If you're checking this mod out, you're probably like me, wondering where From The Shadows went off to.  Well, I'm not sure why the original mod was taken down, but it was licensed under the MIT License, and at least one other person forked the codebase, so I decided to take that and run with it.

Killing ancient demons, cultists that worship these demons, and crafting powerful items from these fiends was fun, and I intend to keep the train rolling.  The original was made by Sonmok14, and I don't plan on making too many changes from the original.

Building

Building the project is done in the standard way for Forge mods.
1. Download the code by cloning the repo or extracting the downloaded .zip file.
2. Open the folder in a terminal and run the included `gradlew` script with the command `build`. Example: `./gradlew build`
3. Navigate to `build/libs`. The compiled .jar file is located in this folder.
